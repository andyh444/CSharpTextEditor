-Tidy up tab stuff?
-Improve on auto-formatting when pressing { } and ;
-Make work with non-monospace fonts
-Async syntax highlighting
-Expose more functionality in CodeEditorBox API (e.g. specify assemblies)
-Consider accessibility
-Sort out public/internal class accessibility in core and winforms projects

-Bugs:
	-&& operator hides the space after it in C# (e.g. type in "true && false", it will show as "true &&false ")
	-when an action is undone, a redraw is triggered before the syntax highlighting is updated
	
-User Interface:
	-click and drag selection to move it
	-(high priority) fix horizontal and vertical scroll bar maxima
	-subwords
	-collapsible regions
	-right-click context menu
	-merge overlapping selection ranges when adding new one with mouse
	-Ctrl+F, Ctrl+G Commands
	-Draw error locations on vertical drag bar

-Syntax highlighting:
	-(high priority) Syntax highlighting for outstanding symbols: managed/unmanaged keywords
	-Highlight XML summaries
	-target-typed constructor invocations (i.e. "new()") isn't syntax highlighted
	-different colour for interface types

-Code completion:
	-Build on suggestions form
		-(high priority) Code completion icons for: enums, delegates, events, and any others
		-Show suggestions on space and character typing
		-(high priority) Use selected suggestion from form when pressing enter
	-(high priority) Method completion tooltip improvements:
		-don't hide tooltip when pressing left/right or backspace (unless cursor goes outside of brackets)
		-don't hide tooltip when showing completion form
		-when above done, update bold statement when pressing left/right/backspace
		-show tooltip when pressing enter (can't remember what this means?)
	-tooltips for enum not right
	-hover tooltips not right

-Refactoring:
	-Rename symbols
