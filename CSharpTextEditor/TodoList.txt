-Code completion:
	-Build on suggestions form

	-(high priority) Method completion tooltip improvements:
		-don't hide tooltip when pressing left/right or backspace (unless cursor goes outside of brackets)
		-don't hide tooltip when showing completion form

		-when above done, update bold statement when pressing left/right/backspace
		-show tooltip when pressing enter (can't remember what this means?)
		-tooltip doesn't currently show if there's one or more overloads (because there's more than one candidate symbol)
		-once the above is fixed, have the option to cycle between the overloads with up and down
	-GetSuggestionAtPosition without the try-catch
	-Show symbol icon in hover tooltip
