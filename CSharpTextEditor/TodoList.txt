-Tidy up tab stuff?
-Improve on auto-formatting when pressing { } and ;

-Bugs:
	-undo/redo doesn't handle pasting well
	-adding nameof breaks the syntax highlighting on the first line
	-(high priority) multi-caret editing doesn't work properly when 2 carets are on same line

-User Interface:
	-Insert mode
	-Expand undo/redo:
		-selection ranges should be restored (rather than just the head)
		-action for insert text when multi-caret select
	-Alt + Up/Down shortcut
	-to uppercase/lowercase shortcuts

	-(high priority) fix horizontal and vertical scroll bar maxima
	-(high priority) Blinking cursor
	-draw scrollbars in dark mode?
	-collapsible regions
	-right-click context menu

-Syntax highlighting:
	-Inherited classes/interface not syntax highlighted (is this still true?)
	-(high priority) Syntax highlighting for outstanding symbols: var, nameof, stackalloc, value? volatile? contextual keywords
	-Highlight XML summaries
	-Draw error locations on vertical drag bar
	-directives

-Code completion:
	-Build on suggestions form
		-(high priority) Don't show suggestions if the '.' character is added as a decimal point, or if in the middle of a comment or string literal
		-(high priority) Code completion icons for: enums, delegates, events, and any others
		-Show suggestions on space and character typing
		-(high priority) Use selected suggestion from form when pressing enter
	-(high priority) Method completion tooltip improvements:
		-don't hide tooltip when pressing left/right or backspace (unless cursor goes outside of brackets)
		-don't hide tooltip when showing completion form
		-bold parameters not drawn correctly - measurements are based on non-bold font
		-when above done, update bold statement when pressing left/right/backspace
		-show tooltip when pressing enter (can't remember what this means?)
		-tooltip doesn't currently show if there's one or more overloads (because there's more than one candidate symbol)
		-once the above is fixed, have the option to cycle between the overloads with up and down
	-GetSuggestionAtPosition without the try-catch
	-Show symbol icon in hover tooltip

-Refactoring:
	-Rename symbols
