# CSharpTextEditor
A WinForms control I've been putting together that can be used for writing and editing C# code. Useful for scripts and such.

At the moment, it can:
- Do roslyn-based syntax highlighting 
- Multi-caret editing via box select
- Limited code completion

My aim is to refine and expand upon all of the above, and maybe expand on this control to work with other languages, like Visual Basic.

## Getting started
To get started, just place the CodeEditorBox control into your WinForms control/form and start writing some C#! You can set the text that goes into it using the SetText method, and get the text from it using GetText.
