# CSharpTextEditor
A WinForms control I've been putting together that can be used for writing and editing C# code. Useful for scripts and such.

At the moment, it can:
-Do roslyn-based syntax highlighting 
-Multi-caret editing via box select
-Limited code completion

My aim is to refine and expand upon all of the above, and maybe expand on this control to work with other languages, like Visual Basic.
